Create an IAM User with the following permissions policy. The app will use this user's credentials.
```JSON
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ListAndDescribeOrganization",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "organizations:ListAccounts",
                "organizations:DescribeOrganization"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AssumeRoleInSubAccounts",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole"

Permissions Policy:
```JSON
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
